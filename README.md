# PWR/SWR-Meter

This arduino program reads forward and reverse power from a tandem coupler through two AD8307. It shows the average power, the peak power over the last 1.5 seconds and the SWR based on the average readings. The hardware design was inspired by [DL6GL and DG1KPN](http://dl6gl.de/digitales-swr-powermeter-mit-pep-anzeige).

## Disclaimer
I develop this tool for myself and just for fun in my free time. If you find it useful, I'm happy to hear about that. If you have trouble using it, you have all the source code to fix the problem yourself (although pull requests are welcome).
